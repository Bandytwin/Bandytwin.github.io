## GoDaddy - Microbusiness Density Forecasting 
[Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/godaddy-microbusiness-density-forecasting)

**Project description:** The goal of this competition is to forecast monthly microbusiness density over the next 6 months for county in the U.S. This work will help policymakers gain visibility into microbusinesses, a growing trend of very small entities. Additional information will enable new policies and programs to improve the success and impact of these smallest of businesses.

My final forecasting solution scored in the top 4% in terms of accuarcy from over 3,500 teams.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
