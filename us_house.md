## The US House of Reps and Gerrymandering

**Project description:** This project walks through an analysis of election returns data for the US House of Representatives, and specifically focuses on the benefits and drawbacks of using the Efficiency Gap (EG) metric to help ID gerrymandering. The data is processed to handle non-standard electiosn (uncontested elections, special elections, runoffs, etc.), theoretical properties of EG are explored, and the variation of EG between states and across time are analyzed.
