  Hi, I’m Andrew, a data scientist with over six years of professional experience. I’m an expert in all project development stages, and most recently worked on market testing, financial modeling, and product initiatives. 
  I approach my work with curiosity, high integrity, and ownership, ensuring I always deliver robust and effective solutions. As someone who is very mission-driven, I’m most passionate about projects focused on helping improve people’s lives. 
  Currently, I’m most concerned about contributing to solutions to help avert the worst impacts from climate change. While taking the past year to focus on improving my data science skillset, I've also been writing a fantasy novel. 
  I’m always open to new job or collaboration opportunities, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbcowley/">LinkedIn</a> .

  # Outside of work I like to, well, get outside. Trail running, backpacking, skiing, and soccer are just a few of the activities I love doing in and around the mountains of my home in Colorado. When the weather gets less agreeable just give me a story-driven video game or fun fiction book and I'll be happy.
  # My favorite books I've read recently are Golden Son, by Pierce Brown, and The Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss.
